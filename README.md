# **Analysis of Indian Prime Ministers and GDP Dataset -->**
This project focuses on analyzing the dataset of Indian prime ministers and their corresponding GDP at that time. The goal is to gain insights into the relationship between political leadership and economic growth in India. We utilize various Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, and Seaborn, to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize the findings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical information on Indian prime ministers, including their names, tenures, political parties, and the corresponding GDP (Gross Domestic Product) during their respective periods. The dataset is derived from reliable sources and has been preprocessed for analysis.

## EDA and Visualization
Using the powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities of Pandas and NumPy, we perform EDA to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. Key aspects of the analysis include:

## Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and data validation.
#### Descriptive statistics: Summarizing the dataset, calculating mean, median, and other statistical measures.
#### Time series analysis: Exploring the trends in GDP over the periods of different prime ministers.
#### Correlation analysis: Examining the relationship between prime ministers' tenures and GDP growth.
To enhance the visual representation of our findings, we utilize Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn to create insightful charts, graphs, and visualizations.

## Results and Insights
Through our analysis, we aim to derive valuable insights and observations, such as:

Identifying prime ministers who served during periods of significant economic growth or decline.
Analyzing the impact of different political parties and ideologies on GDP trends.
Exploring any patterns or relationships between the length of prime ministers' tenures and GDP growth.
Our visualizations provide intuitive representations of the data, making it easier to understand and interpret the results.

## Results and Insights
#### During our analysis of the dataset, we made a notable observation regarding the GDP levels under different prime ministers:

**Charan Singh**, who served as the Prime Minister of India, had the lowest recorded GDP during his tenure.
On the other hand, **Manmohan Singh**, as the Prime Minister, oversaw a period of relatively higher GDP growth.
These findings shed light on the varying economic scenarios and policy environments during the terms of different prime ministers. However, it's important to note that the analysis is based on historical data and should be interpreted within the context of the prevailing economic conditions and other influencing factors.

The visualizations and statistical analysis in the Jupyter Notebook provide a more comprehensive overview of the dataset and allow for further exploration and interpretation.

We encourage you to explore the code and the dataset in detail to gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns observed during different prime ministers' tenures.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or build upon it, you can clone this repository and access the Jupyter Notebook file. The Notebook contains the code used for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Feel free to modify or expand upon the code to suit your specific needs.

## Conclusion
This project's analysis of the Indian Prime Ministers and GDP dataset using Python libraries showcases the relationship between political leadership and economic growth. The specific finding of Charan Singh having the lowest GDP and Manmohan Singh overseeing high GDP growth offers insights into the economic landscapes during their respective tenures.

We hope that this project serves as a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and individuals interested in studying the historical context of Indian politics and its impact on the economy.
